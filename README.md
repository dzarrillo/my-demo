## Concept and Utilization

Boo!camp Spot allows users to view haunted places from around the world. Each place has a card with its title, location, description, and image. Places can be filtered by type (Building, Forests, Prisons, etc.). After clicking the card, the user is directed to the place's page, which also shows reviews and accounts from other users who have visited. 

Users who have signed up can create new places as well as submit their own reviews. On the user's profile page, places and reviews created by the user can be edited or deleted. Other information, such as the user's gravatar image, username, and 'boo day' (date of sign up) is also displayed. 

## About

### Overview

This app uses a node.js/express server and a SQL database for the backend. The files served to the front end are created using handlebars templates (server-side rendering). However, there is still a significant amount of client-side rendering. For example, some of the data in the front end is loaded via AJAX queries to backend API routes and subsequent dynamic rendering. Authentication is accomplished via JSON web tokens and passport.

### Data Integrity

* To ensure that the data entering the database is what is desired, several layers of validation were utilized: 
  * front end form validations via JavaScript and jQuery
  * sequelize model validations
  * SQL database constraints (data type, null/not null, unique, etc.)

### API Usage

* While the thumbnail images for places comes from randomly selecting from a set of 12 static images, the image on each place's page comes from the Flickr API.
* The title of the haunted place is used as the search term for a Flickr API route, and a randomly selected link to a static asset is used as the source for the image. 

## Demo

* [deployed link](https://boocamp-spot.herokuapp.com/)

* New users who sign up will be redirected to a user profile page, which will show their gravatar image, username, email, and 'boo day' (date the account was created). Any haunted places or reviews they create will also be visible on their profile page.
